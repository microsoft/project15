# Deploying Project 15 from Microsoft Open Platform

Azure Time Series Insights (TSI) requires implicit access permission using Azure Active Directory.  Currently there is no easy way to configure Azure Active Directory though the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template, therefore, we are asking you to take a number of small manual steps as a temporary solution.

Click `Deploy to Azure` button below  

> [!TIP]  
> Right click the button below and select `Open link in new tab` or `Open lin in new window`

<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2Fproject15%2Fmaster%2FDeploy%2Fazuredeploy.json" target="_blank"><img src="deploy-to-azure.svg"/></a>

## 1. Start Cloud Shell

An Azure service principal is a security identity used by user-created apps, services, and automation tools to access specific Azure resources.  Instead of having to manage access permission for each user, the web site will use the Service Principal to access data from TSI.

1. When you are at `Custom Deployment` page, open `Cloud Shell`

    ![Deployment 01](media/Deployment-01.png)

1. Make sure to select `bash` in the dropdown list on the top left corner to Cloud Shell

    ![Deployment 02](media/Deployment-02.png)

    You may see a warning message.  Please click `Confirm` to switch to `Bash`

    ![Deployment 03](media/Deployment-03.png)

## 2. Create Service Principal

In Cloud Shell, copy & paste the entire block below

```bash
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/project15/master/Deploy/tsi-setup.sh -O ./tsi-setup.sh --no-cache && chmod +x tsi-setup.sh && ./tsi-setup.sh
```

You may copy the command from the `Run this command` field.

> [!TIP]
> To paste into Cloud Shell console, right click in Cloud Shell pane, then select paste.

![Deployment 04](media/Deployment-04.png)

Once the command completes, you will find 4 output lines in the Cloud Shell. This process takes roughly a minute.  

![Deployment 05](media/Deployment-05.png)

## 3. Enter Service Principal Information into the Template

Now provide Service Principal IDs and password into the template.

Copy & paste `Service Principal App Id`, `Service Principal Password`, `Service Principal Tenant Id`, and `Service Principal Object Id` into respective input boxes.

![Deployment 06](media/Deployment-06.png)

## 4. Start Deployment

1. Select `Subscription` (if you have more than one)
1. Create a new `Resource Group` by clicking `Create new`  

    e.g. `MySolution`

    ![Deployment 07](media/Deployment-07.png)

1. Select `Region` and `IoT Hub Location`, then click `Review + create`  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > As of 9/11/2020, the solution accelerator uses new IoT Plug and Play features.  
    > IoT Plug and Play is enabled in these regions. IoT Plug and Play will be enabled in all regions in the end of September 2020.
    > Please select **Central US**, **Japan East**, or **North Europe**

    ![Deployment 08](media/Deployment-08.png)

1. Review all parameters are filled, then click `Create` to start deployment

    ![Deployment 09](media/Deployment-09.png)

1. Wait for ~ 15 minutes for the deployment to complete

    ![Deployment 10](media/Deployment-10.png)

## 5. Post Deployment

1. Once deployment is complete, click on `Outputs`

    ![Deployment 11](media/Deployment-11.png)

1. Click the button to copy `Post Deployment Command`, then right click in Cloud Shell window to paste the command

    ![Deployment 12](media/Deployment-12.png)

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If Cloud Shell is disconnected for timeout, click `Reconnect`

1. Hit `Enter` key to run the command

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The command does not display any output.

1. After the command completes, copy `Web Site Address` and open in a new browser window or tab to see the sample portal site

    ![Deployment 13](media/Deployment-13.png)

## Sample Portal Site

The sample portal site has 4 big sections.

![Deployment 14](media/Deployment-14.png)

1. Azure Time Series Insights (TSI)  

    Telemetry and events from devices are sent to TSI.  
    This sample reads Temperature and Humidity data stored in TSI, and displays line charts

    More information on TSI : <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/time-series-insights/overview-what-is-tsi>

1. Azure Maps

    For solutions to integrate location based services (e.g. GPS).  The sample only displays map.

1. Device Management  

    Examples of how to register, delete, retrieve device information.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Currently the sample does not provide a way to interact with Device Provisioning Service.

1. Device Telemetry and Events  

    Examples of how to receive real-time data from the backend system.  Receives and displays all device telemetry and events.

## Send Temperature from Raspberry Pi Simulator

1. Click on `+Add Device`

    ![Deployment 15](media/Deployment-15.png)

1. Give a name to a new device, then click `+Add`  

    E.g. RP-Simulator

    > [!TIP]  
    > The name is called `Device ID`.  
    > A case-sensitive string (up to 128 characters long) of alphanumeric characters plus certain special characters: - . + % _ # * ? ! ( ) , : = @ $ '

    ![Deployment 16](media/Deployment-16.png)

1. Make sure the device just created is selected in the list, and the device is in `Enabled` state.  

    Click on `Copy Connection String`.  
    We will use this later with Raspberry Pi simulator.

    ![Deployment 17](media/Deployment-17.png)

1. Click on `Raspberry Pi Simulator`

    ![Deployment 18](media/Deployment-18.png)

    This will open a new browser tab.

    ![Deployment 19](media/Deployment-19.png)

1. Browse to line #15 in the top right pane, and replace `[Your IoT hub device connection string]` with the connection string

    ![Deployment 20](media/Deployment-20.png)

    ![Deployment 21](media/Deployment-21.png)

    The line should look like :

    ```c
    const connectionString = 'HostName=Hub-q7fec.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=RP-Simulator;SharedAccessKey=)(*)()(*)()()=';
    ```

1. Click `Run` to start sending Temperature and Humidity data

    ![Deployment 22](media/Deployment-22.png)

1. Open the web app from the solution, then click `Refresh` to see temperature and humidity data in line graph

    ![Deployment 23](media/Deployment-23.png)
